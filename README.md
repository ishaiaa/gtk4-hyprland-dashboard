# gtk4-hyprland-dashboard
(W.I.P)

This repository contains the sourcecode of my system dashboard, personalized for my 21:9 screen.
I do not plan to maintain this project, but feel free to use and modify it :3 
(just keep in mind that this was my first ever gtk project, so the code might be a bit messy xD)
